  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I am an enthusiastic and driven Process Engineer with a wide range of skills in the water industry <br>
    including design, process support, operations, commissioning and people management. My passion lies in <br>
    solving problems through analysis of control system and laboratory data to optimise operations to achieve <br>
    performance KPIs and aim for continuous improvement around regulatory, environmental, safety and financial <br>
    targets.</p>

    <p>I am experienced in preparing data for reporting to government bodies as well as internal reporting to <br>
      stakeholders around HACCP and process performance. My current enrolment in a Data Analytics course will <br>
      hone my analytical skills as I aim to further immerse myself in the data space; Iâ€™m a sucker for a good <br>
      spreadsheet!</p>
